                        <p>You  can place two types of bids in the Timed Auction system</p> 
                        <ul class="o-faq-list__secondary"> 
                            <li><span class="t-bold">Maximum Bid</span> Enter the amount you are willing to bid up to in the blank field, then click Maximum Bid. The system will put you in at the lowest bid possible and then bid for you, up to and including the amount you specify. Your Maximum Bid will be kept secret from the other bidders, and the system will only raise your bid if someone outbids you. A Maximum Bid is similar to a proxy bid.</li> 
                            <li><span class="t-bold">Quick Bid:</span> Click the Quick Bid button to place a bid at the next highest increment. It’s just like raising your bid book in the live auction. Note: you may be outbid right away, especially if someone has placed a higher Maximum Bid.</li> 
                        </ul> 
                        <div class="o-message__info h-mt-200">Tip: save time by placing a Maximum Bid. The system will bid for you, so you don’t have to stay online. </div>

                    <li class="o-faq-item">
                        <h3 class="t-h3">What are the valid bid increments for placing maximum bids?</h3>
                        <p>When creating a maximum bid you must bid according to these pre-set bidding increments:</p>
                        <!-- @include '/assets/components/components/increment-table' -->
                    </li>

                    <li class="o-faq-item">
                        <h3 class="t-h3">How will I know if  you’ve been outbid and need to bid again?</h3>
                        <p>Bids will be processed as they are entered and you will see the result of your bid on the screen right away. Because someone may have placed an earlier Maximum Bid that was equal to or greater than your bid, you may be outbid right away. </p>
                        <p>You can find out if you have been outbid</p> 
                        <ul class="o-faq-list__secondary"> 
                            <li>By signing up for email alerts: click on Manage Alerts in the Timed Auction system and provide your email address. You will receive an alert when you are outbid on an item you were high bidder on. Note: you will not receive any alerts during the last five minutes of bidding.</li> 
                            <li>By signing in to the Timed Auction system: look under "Watching and Bidding" to see the items you’ve placed bids on. Make sure you set the filter to “All Lots”.</li> 
                        </ul> 
                    </li>
                    
                    <li class="o-faq-item"> 
                        <h3 class="t-h3">I was outbid by someone else who placed a bid for the same amount. Why?</h3>
                        <p>If two people place equal bids, the bid that was placed first is accepted as the highest bid. If you place a bid and are outbid right away, it is probably because someone placed an earlier Maximum Bid.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li class="o-faq-item">
                        <h3 class="t-h3">I placed a Maximum Bid but I’ve changed my mind. Can I cancel my bid?</h3> 
                        <p>No. Every bid placed at a Ritchie Bros. auction is final and irrevocable. You cannot cancel or retract any bids you place in the Timed Auction system. When you place a Quick Bid or Maximum Bid, you will be asked to confirm your bid to ensure that you don’t place any bids by mistake. </p> 
                        <p>However, if you are the current high bidder, you can reduce your Maximum Bid to the next increment above your current high bid. </p>

                    <li class="o-faq-item">
                        <h3 class="t-h3">What does "Time Added" mean and why did it happen?</h3> 
                        <p>If any bids are placed on a lot with less than <strong class="">2 minutes remaining</strong> the timed auction automatically extends the closing time for that lot to give other bidders a chance to increase their bids in response.</p>
                        <strong>So when will bidding for a lot actually close?</strong> 
                        <p>It depends on how many people continue to bid on the lot. If people continue to place bids, the lot will continue to have time added and it will remain open until no new bids are placed and the added time runs out.</p>
                    </li class="o-faq-item">

                        <h3 class="t-h3">How do I know if I was the highest bidder?</h3>
                        <p>You can find out if an item was sold to you in the Timed Auction system: check under "Watching and Bidding" (make sure you select Sold Lots from the dropdown menu) or click View Purchases. You can also ask at the registration counter on-site or sign up for email alerts: we’ll let you know by email if you are the highest bidder.</p>

                        <h3 class="t-h3">Are there any extra fees for the Timed Auction?</h3>
                        <p>Regular Ritchie Bros. terms of bidding and sale apply to the Timed Auction, including deposit and payment rules and fees. There are no special charges but you may be  required to pay the following standard fees (in addition to applicable taxes)</p> 
                        <ul class="o-faq-list__secondary"> 
                            <li>2.5% administrative fee for lots selling for more than 2,500, up to a maximum of 950 per lot (in the currency of the auction, or in the case of Japan, up to a maximum of 95,000 Yen for lots selling for more than 250,000 Yen). </li> 
                            <li>10% administrative fee for lots selling for 2,500 or less (in the currency of the auction, or 250,000 Yen in Japan).</li>

                        <p>Make sure you have provided your email address in the Timed Auction system, even if you have given your email address to Ritchie Bros. in the past (e.g. when you registered). You can update your email address by clicking on Manage Alerts in the Timed Auction system. Please note</p>

                            <li>You must provide your       email address for each individual Timed Auction (e.g. if you are       participating in the Timed Auction in Houston       and Los Angeles,       you must provide your email address twice).</li> 
                            <li>You will not receive any alerts during the last five minutes of bidding.</li>

                        <p>If you want to buy a certain type of item, rather than a specific lot, you can create a choice group under "My Choice Groups". You select the items you’d like to bid on, specify the maximum number you’d like to buy and then place a Maximum Bid. </p>

                        <p>If an item has been sold or removed from the sale, or if you placed a bid on it as part of a choice group, the bid buttons will be removed from the item. If you want to increase your bid on an item in a choice group, click the link to "My Choice Groups". </p>

                        <h3 class="t-h3">Will the items in the Timed Auction be sold in the live auction as well?</h3>
                        <p>No: an item is either sold by Timed Auction or in the live auction, not both. Every Timed Auction lot has a specific closing time; the highest bidder at that time is the new owner of that item.</p>

                        <p>In most cases, you will place your bids on individual lots under the All Listings tab. However, if you want to buy a certain type of item, rather than a specific lot, you can create and bid on a choice group under "My Choice Groups".</p> 
                        <p>For example, if we’re selling 10 identical gen sets and you want to buy three of them, you can create a choice group out of the 10 items and specify that you want a quantity of up to three.</p>

                            <li>You cannot bid on an individual item after you’ve added it to a choice group. The bid button will be disabled.</li>

                            <li>The system will bid for you, up to and including your Maximum Bid; if you are the high bidder on an item when bidding closes, that item will be sold to you at your current high bid (even if your Maximum Bid was higher).</li>

                        <p>In most cases, you cannot dissolve a choice group that you have created. However, you can dissolve a choice group if you are no longer an ‘active bidder’ on any of the lots in your group. You are no longer an active bidder if you have been outbid or if an item is sold (to you or someone else). (A &gt;&gt; Dissolve Group button will appear in this case.) After you dissolve the group, you can bid on one or more items from that group (unless they have been sold). </p>
